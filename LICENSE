Menlo Park, California, U.S.A. All rights reserved.

NOTE: This License is not the same as any of the GNU Licenses published by
the Free Software Foundation. Its terms are substantially different from
those of the GNU Licenses. If you are familiar with the GNU Licenses, please
read this license with extra care.

Aladdin Enterprises hereby grants to anyone the permission to apply this
License to their own work, as long as the entire License (including the
above notices and this paragraph) is copied with no changes, additions, or
deletions except for changing the first paragraph of Section 0 to refer to
the work with which this License is being distributed and of which it is to
be a part.

The Intent of this License is to ensure that:

- If you redistribute this software, you must distribute the entire package
  including sources.
- You may not charge a fee for this software itself. However, you may charge
  a distribution fee.
- If you modify this software, you may distribute your modifications under
  the terms of this License.

0. Subject Matter

This License applies to the computer program known as "xhs_auto_publisher_js".
The "Program", below, refers to such program. The Program is a copyrighted
work whose copyright is held by the copyright holder specified in the Program
or in this License.

A "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work
of the Program, as defined in the United States Copyright Act of 1976, such
as a translation or a modification.

"Source Code" means the preferred form of a work for making modifications to
it.

1. Licenses.

Aladdin Enterprises hereby grants you the following rights, provided that you
comply with all of the restrictions set forth in this License and provided
that you distribute a Standard Version of the Program including all the
copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

(a) You may make and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's Source Code
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

(b) You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
also meet all of these conditions:

    (i) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
    that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    (ii) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
    thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
    under the terms of this License.

2. Restrictions.

You may not charge a fee for the Program itself. You may charge a fee for
the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer
warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License.

3. Copying Restrictions.

You may not copy or distribute the Program except as expressly permitted in
this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy or distribute the Program is
void and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under
this License.

4. Acceptance.

You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

5. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you redistribute the Program, the recipient automatically receives
a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the
Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.

6. Contradiction Between Terms.

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are
imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License.

7. NO WARRANTY.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

8. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA
OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
